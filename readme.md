# Goal
  I wanted to create a wizard like tool that can generate basic structure of a test case. The generated side can be loaded back into selenium ide. And continue from there.

## Use case
1. I always have to create a bunch of variable in the selenium ide. The editor can be sometime annoying. Eg. Adding execute script command with the long javascript. And it is usual quite similar, maybe different in selector in most case.
2. Assert is compulsory, for every test case, maybe all elements just have to store somewhere and the tool will picked them up and assert them.
3. Some standard log printing can be done as dependency injection. Allowing to know what really happen on the testing flow.


## What i want it to be
1. I want this tool to be able to generate the basic structure of a test case with repeated things automated. I want to use selenium ide to really do testing. Target on the logic, what the element suppose to react. Keep the repeated and common to this tool.
2. The generated side can be drag and drop back to the tool, and the wizard can be populated of what have been already done. And i can continue to work on it.

## Aside to this project.
1. I would like to learn react. so i will be using react to create the UI for this tool.

# Wish me luck!
